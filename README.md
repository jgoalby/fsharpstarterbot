This site is based on [suave-fshome](https://github.com/tpetricek/suave-fshome) by [@tpetricek](https://github.com/tpetricek) which
in turn is based on [suavebootstrapper](https://github.com/shanselman/suavebootstrapper) by [@shanselman](http://github.com/shanselman). 
It is a small sample that shows how to create a Microsoft BotFramework bot using [FSharp](http://fsharp.org) and [Suave.io](https://suave.io), 
that can be hosted on both Azure and Heroku.
